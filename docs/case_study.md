# Case Study — Sovereign MeshPoint

## Overview
A laptop‑based prototype designed to extend VPN‑protected Wi‑Fi coverage without sacrificing speed.  
Tested across multiple cities, delivering stable connections and reduced latency in gaming.

## Key Insight
Local servers provided the best performance.  
Faraway servers connected but were unstable — highlighting the importance of proximity in VPN routing.

## Reflection
This project demonstrates how <$200 in hardware can be transformed into a portable, secure mesh system.  
It blends technical troubleshooting with creative documentation, showing both process and outcome.
